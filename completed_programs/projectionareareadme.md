1. Download image files
2. Create new folder where analysis results will go
3. Copy this folder's filepath. 
4. Start the macro
5. Paste in the filepath and add "/" to the end on Mac or "\" on windows
6. Open with normal BioFormats parameters
7. Scrub through z-stack to get best slices for projection
8. Select threshold you like best and hit apply. Remember it can have a lot of noise, you just need clear macrophages so that we can isolate them later
9. After this, make sure the threshold in the second screen is the same as the first. Do not hit any other buttons.
10. Now connect macrophages broken by threshold with white pen tool as needed
11. Using flood fill tool with pre-selected color (do not change it) select each macrophage. 
12. When finished, hit ok, then wait for program to get to projection area portion
13. Select all macrophages with polygon tool. It will bug if you don't
14. When finished, hit ok, then wait for program to get to soma area portion
15. Same as above (#13)
16. Analysis is complete! All ROI coordinates, microglia images, and results are saved in your target folder.
